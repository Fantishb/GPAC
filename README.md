# General Purpose Amharic Corpus (GPAC) - will be uploaded soon

General Purpose Amharic Corpus (GPAC) version 1.0. CACO is a body of huge Amharic text collected from various sources. The corpus contains about ### documents and #### tokens. This corpus was created putting two objectives in mind. (1) To use it (together with other corpora) in the training of an Amharic word embedding using fasttext which was in turn used in a fake news detection research [4]. (2) To fill the gap of the shortage of Amharic corpus for deep learning applications and other NLP researches etc. 

Amharic is a highly influential language with its own ancient script. Not to mention its early existence and applications, it has been the working language of courts, the military, language of trade, and everyday communications since the late 12th century, and remains the official language of the Ethiopian government today [1,2]. Most of the Ethiopian Jewish communities in Ethiopia and Israel speak Amharic. InWashington DC, Amharic became one of the six non-English languages in the Language Access Act of 2004, which allows government services and education in Amharic [3]. Furthermore, Amharic is considered as a sacred language by Rastafarians. Despite Amharic being highly powerful,
it is still one of the “low-resource” languages in the world. A lack of sufficient corpora and linguistic tools to help use technology make the language disadvantaged in this
regard. Since an already existing corpora and other resources are limited, we hope this will fill some portion of the gap.
